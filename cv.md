### Summary
---------   
A little **background** story:
>My  first meeting with IT word was at the university, when i did laboratory classes in Visual Basic :smirk:. I was so exited about opportunities and results in coding, so i even decide  to make my own interactive strategy game. I spend much time trying to bring my ideas with realizing this project and this was very fun. But it was a long time ago... 

Today i feel that it was some sort of signal, so i decide to umprove my skills and change my life. 
I believe, that becoming knowledge in web-design, programming languages, and developer stuff can help me to realize my ideas in future projects can help people and make them happy
